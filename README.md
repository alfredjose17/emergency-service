Web Page for Implementing IVR in a Hospital. Every healthcare firm has to maintain compliance and organisational quality. To abide with the rules and regulations, emergency colour code standards should be complied upon to deal with different types of hazardous situations. If there is an emergency, the code and location should be announced in the public address system and concerned staff should take immediate steps to deal with the issue. For example the emergency code for fire is ‘red’ and for a cardiac emergency in a ward it is ‘blue’. 

In case of emergency, it becomes extremely difficult for the officials to alert the entire hospital about the unforeseen circumstances. In such situations, Xtend IVR Audio broadcasting system proves to be useful as it offers the capability to make the announce the emergency code in all the departments at a time. Deployment of this automated announcement system reduces conventional risks and improves safety in the healthcare establishment.
